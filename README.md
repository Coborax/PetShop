# PetShop üê∂
Pet Shop School Project

**NOTE. This is a savepoint for my CSharp Crash Course hand in**

This project will evolve into a Pet Shop Web App. 
The following technologies will be used:
- ASP.NET Core for the WebAPI
- EF Core for Data Access
- Angular for the Frontend

## Savepoints (Branches)
During the development of this project I will create various saves of previous versions of the project (Mostly used for hand-ins)
- [main](https://github.com/Coborax/PetShop/tree/main) Newest version of the project
- [checkpoint-cscc](https://github.com/Coborax/PetShop/tree/checkpoint-cscc) Hand in state for my CSharp Crash Course hand in

## Folders
- `PetShop.Core` Core Models and Interfaces
- `PetShop.Domain` Domain logic
- `PetShop.Infrastructure.Data.InMemory` In memory implementations of repositories
- `PetShop.RestAPI` Rest API
- `PetShop.ConsoleUI` Console App using that uses the services directly
